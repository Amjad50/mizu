# Gameboy Scribbltests

The Scribbltests are a (currently very limited) collection of self-written test ROMs for testing all sorts of things. For details, do check the individual test folders.

**Note:** The ROMs in this repository are tested on hardware. The exact models they were tested on as well as the test results are provided in the individual README files.

### Credits, Copyright or whatever

The ROMs in this repository are all written by [me](https://github.com/Hacktix). Thanks to the [Emulation Development Discord](https://discord.gg/7nuaqZ2) as well as the [gbdev Discord](https://discord.gg/gpBxq85) for helping with debugging and verifying the tests, as well as motivating me to write these in the first place.
